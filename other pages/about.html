            <p>collegeWiki went live in June 2013 with a goal of helping the engineering aspirants. We started by
                providing detailed information about different Engineering Colleges & entrance Exams. Soon, we added
                news section for providing the latest news about each exam & their counselling schedule.

                And there are some questions that need discussion, so we created a Forum where students can easily ask,
                answer & discuss questions.</p>
